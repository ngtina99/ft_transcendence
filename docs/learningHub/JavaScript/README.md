Here's the LearningHub for JavaScript - AKA JS.<br><br>
I highly recommend taking a look - even if just skimming through it - as many concepts may sound similar to C++, but are actually quite different.<br>
Knowing those differences could save us a lot of time and debug 💻 <br><br>

## 🔍︎ JS Look-Up chart
👉 [JS_LookUp](JS_LookUp.md) 👈<br><br>
A comparative C++ VS JS chart.<br>
Aims at clearing out doubts quickly and finding key information easily.<br>

## 📚 JS Dive-In
👉 [JS_DiveIn](JS_DiveIn.md) 👈<br><br>
A summary of my research - focused on learning JS from a C++ perspective.<br>
It's a chapter-by-chapter knowledge base covering the following topics:
- Language & runtime model;
- Values & types;
- Variables & scope;
- Objects & property basics;
- Prototype, constructors, new, classes;
- Functions, arrow functions, closures;
- Arrow functions vs regular functions;
- Arrays, iterables, and iteration;
- Generators & yield;
- Maps, Sets, WeakMaps, WeakSets;
- Promises, async/await, and the event loop;
- Error handling;
- Memory & lifetimes;
- Modules.
