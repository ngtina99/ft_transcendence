## Mandatory minimum

A minimum of *7 major* modules is required. Two Minor Modules count as one Major Module.

### Basic Website Setup
  - SPA (single page app) with Typescript frontend (moving around doesn’t reload the whole page, instead, JavaScript updates only the part of the page that changes)
  - Runs in Docker with one command (docker-compose up --build)
  - Works at least in Firefox, no visible errors  

### Pong Game Basics
  - Local Pong (2 players on same keyboard)  
  - Tournament system with aliases + matchmaking (organizes multiple players into a series of matches until a winner is decided, nicknames players type in before the tournament starts, the system automatically decides who plays against who, and in which order)
  - Same paddle speed for everyone  

### Security
  - Passwords hashed (“hashed” means you don’t store the real password in the database, e.g.: password = "hello123" → stored as "5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592")
  - Protection against SQL injection / XSS (login field: ' OR '1'='1 can trick and log them without password, <script>alert('Hacked!')</script>, webattacks)
  - HTTPS everywhere  
  - Input validation (client/server depending on setup) (user input checks: email, passwrod, alias/nickname, Client-side validation = checked in the browser with JavaScript before sending, Server-side validation = checked again on the backend)
  - Secrets in `.env` (not in git)  

## Modules explanation

### Web
- **Major: Backend framework** → Use something like Django, NestJS, or Express instead of plain PHP.  
- **Minor: Frontend framework/toolkit** → Use React, Vue, or Angular to build the interface.  
- **Minor: Database** → Store user info, match history, scores, etc.  
- **Major: Blockchain scores** → Save tournament results on blockchain so they can’t be manipulated.

### User Management
- **Major: Standard user management** → Sign up, log in, password reset, and keep the same user across tournaments.  
- **Major: Remote authentication** → Log in using Google, GitHub, Facebook or another external provider.  

### Gameplay & User Experience
- **Major: Remote players** → Play Pong against someone online, not just on the same keyboard.  
- **Major: Multiplayer (more than 2)** → Support 3+ players in one game.  
- **Major: Add another game** → Add a second game (besides Pong), with history and matchmaking.  
- **Minor: Game customization** → Let players change colors, themes, or game speed.  
- **Major: Live chat** → Players can chat with each other while playing.  

### AI–Algo
- **Major: AI opponent** → Add a computer-controlled player to play against.  
- **Minor: Stats dashboard** → Show charts/tables with wins, losses, rankings, etc.  

### Cybersecurity
- **Major: WAF + Vault** → Web Application Firewall to block attacks, and Vault to securely store secrets (passwords, keys). CI/CD pipeline asks Vault for temporary DB credentials instead of storing passwords in Git. WAF protects the deployed apps that your CI/CD pipeline delivers to production.
- **Minor: GDPR compliance** → Follow privacy laws: anonymize data, let users delete accounts.  
- **Major: 2FA + JWT** → Add Two-Factor Authentication (extra login code) and JWT (JSON Web Token, e.g.:eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...) tokens for secure sessions, instead of sending your username/password on every request

### DevOps
- **Major: Log management** → Collect and centralize logs (errors, activity). Good for debugging. 
- **Minor: Monitoring system** → Track server performance, uptime, and alerts.  
- **Major: Microservices backend** → Split the app into small services (auth service, game service, chat service, etc.). Each doing one job, each service runs in its own container (Docker). They talk to each other via APIs (HTTP, WebSockets, etc.). If something crashes probably others can stay alive. 

### Graphics
- **Major: Advanced 3D** → Use 3D graphics (like WebGL or Three.js) to make the game look more advanced.  

### Accessibility
- **Minor: Support on all devices** → Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile.  
- **Minor: Browser compatibility** → Works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.  
- **Minor: Multiple languages** → Translate UI into different languages.  
- **Minor: Accessibility features** → Add support for visually/physically impaired players (no mouse usage, screen readers, high contrast).  
- **Minor: Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** → Render pages on the server before sending them, faster load and SEO friendly.

### Server-Side Pong
- **Major: Server-side Pong + API** → Game logic runs on the server, with an API so clients can connect. (Each browser might run the game slightly differently. One player could cheat by changing their browser code
ball.x = myPaddle.x;   // force the ball to always hit my paddle
opponent.score = 0;    // reset opponent score
myScore = 999;         // give myself infinite points. Accepts only player inputs (up/down), never trusts client monitor position. Syncing between two browsers is messy (you need to constantly exchange ball positions, paddle moves, etc.)
- **Major: CLI vs Web gameplay** → Command Line Interface. Allow someone in the command line to play against someone in the web app.

## Risk Map

### 🟢 Low Risk (Safe / Predictable)
- **Backend framework (Major)** → Lets you avoid raw PHP, makes backend cleaner.
- **2FA + JWT** → Security upgrade, relatively standard to implement.  
- **Live chat (Major)** → Straightforward with websockets.  
- **AI opponent (Major)** → Demo-friendly (play vs computer), not too complex if simple AI.  
- **Database (Minor)** → Almost mandatory if you store users/scores.  
- **Game customization (Minor)** → Simple settings (colors, themes).  
- **Stats dashboard (Minor)** → Just display graphs/tables of wins/losses.  
- **Support on all devices** → Responsive design (CSS media queries).  
- **Browser compatibility** → Test across browsers, small tweaks.  
- **Multiple languages** → Add i18n (translation files).  
- **Accessibility features** → High contrast, screen reader support.  
- **SSR integration (Minor)** → Use framework built-ins (e.g., Next.js). (The framework already has that feature included by default.)
- **Frontend framework/toolkit (Minor)** — React/Vue/Angular basics are well documented.

### 🟡 Medium Risk (Manageable with Planning)
- **Standard user management (Major)** → Account lifecycle, resets, edge cases.  
- **Remote authentication (Major)** → Redirects/tokens/config can be really hard.  
- **Monitoring system (Minor)** → Prometheus/Grafana setup, exporters, alerts.

### 🔴 High Risk (Heavy / Time-Consuming)
- **Blockchain scores** → Complex and heavy for little evaluation gain.
- **Remote players** → Netcode, network latency, reconnection handling: hard to debug.
- **Multiplayer > 2 players** → More complex game logic.
- **Add another game** → Just extra work.
- **WAF + Vault** → Production-level setup, can take a lot of time.
- **Microservices backend** → Good for learning, but adds infrastructure complexity. 
- **Advanced 3D graphics** → Risky if nobody on team knows WebGL/Three.js before. 
- **Server-side Pong + API** → Needs redesign of simple Pong logic.  
- **CLI vs Web Pong** → Extra integration layer: frontend-backend connection.
