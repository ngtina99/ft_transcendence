/**
 * Saves a remote 1v1 match to the user-service database
 *
 * This function implements race condition prevention by ensuring only the player
 * with the higher user ID saves the match. Since both players' browsers might
 * trigger save attempts simultaneously, this deterministic approach guarantees
 * only one match record is created.
 *
 * The match is saved with type "ONE_VS_ONE" and includes both players' scores.
 * The winner is automatically calculated by the backend based on score comparison.
 *
 * @param {Object} app - Fastify app instance for logging
 * @param {Object} player1 - WebSocket connection object for first player (must have higher ID)
 * @param {Object} player1.user - User object containing id and token
 * @param {Object} player2 - WebSocket connection object for second player
 * @param {Object} player2.user - User object containing id
 * @param {number} score1 - Score achieved by player1
 * @param {number} score2 - Score achieved by player2
 *
 * @returns {Promise<void>} Resolves when save completes (or is skipped)
 *
 * @example
 * // Player 10 vs Player 5: Player 10 saves
 * await saveRemoteMatch(app, player10, player5, 5, 3);
 * // Player 5 vs Player 10: Skipped (will be saved by higher ID player)
